/**
 * COMP 2503 Fall 2023 Assignment 4

 * This program must read a input stream and keeps track of the frequency at
 * which an avenger is mentioned either by name or alias or performer's last name. The program must use HashMaps
 * for keeping track of the Avenger Objects, and it must use TreeMaps
 * for storing the data.
