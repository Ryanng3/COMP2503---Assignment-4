# COMP2503---Assignment-4

Reflection:

-  Based on my experience working with HashMaps and TreeMaps was for sure different
compared to my experience with previous assignments. The first reason was because
during the first 3 assignments, we were given instructions on how to implement
these data structures into our code during tutorial time which helped a lot. However,
in assignment 4, there was no coding tutorial which made it difficult to get started
with the assignment.

-  After I did some research and implemented my HashMap first, it got the ball rolling.
Using what I learned from the previous assignments such as using the different external
comparators and implementing them through the different TreeMaps similiar to assignment
2 and 3, which allowed me to successfully generate the expected output. Overall, this assignment
took a different approach, however, it was similiar to assignments 1-3 which made it much easier to implement.
Everything in my code is functional. From iterating through the HashMap and putting
the given Avenger objects into the TreeMaps and sorting them accordingly based on their comparators.
Along as the word count, and print output are all succsseful.
